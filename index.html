      <h1>A history of Cryptography</h1>
		<h2>The beginnings</h2>
      <p>
      Cryptography, the use of codes and ciphers to protect secrets, began thousands of years ago and has been considered to be born along with the art of writing. As civilizations evolved, human beings got organized in tribes, groups, and kingdoms. This led to the emergence of ideas such as power, battles, supremacy, and politics. These ideas created the need of strategical advantages, requiring the need of secrecy for transmitting messages which has ensured the permanent evolution of cryptography. The roots of cryptography are found in Roman and Egyptian civilizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first known evidence of cryptography can be traced to the use of ‘hieroglyphs’. Hieroglyphs were essentially a mystery because very few people actually knew how to read them, making it a powerful weapon in the hands of kings and their scribes for transmitting crucial information between settlements without the repercussions of people finding out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, the scholars moved on to using simple monoalphabetic substitution ciphers during 500 to 600 BC. This involved replacing the alphabet of messages with other alphabets that use a secret rule. This rule became a key to retrieve the message back from the garbled message. The ancient Greeks used cyphers like these, such as the <a class = "link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scytale">Scytale</a> cipher, used by the Spartans.

		<h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>
      <p>
    	The earlier Roman method of cryptography, popularly known as the Caesar Shift Cipher, relies on shifting the letters of a message by an agreed number (three was a common choice), the recipient of this message would then shift the letters back by the same number and obtain the original message.

		<h2>Evolution of Cryptography</h2>
		<p>
			The invention of the frequency-analysis technique for breaking monoalphabetic substitution ciphers by Al-Kindi, a Arab mathematician around 800 AD became the biggest leap in the evolution of ciphers until World War 2. That made most ciphers vulnerable to the frequency analysis technique until the invention of the polyalphabetic cipher.
			During and after the European Renaissance, various Italian and Papal states led the rapid proliferation of cryptographic techniques.
		</p>
		<p>Improved coding techniques such as <b>Vigenere Coding</b> came into existence in the 15th century. This type of cipher is a polyalphabetic cipher, which offered moving letters in the message with a number of variable places instead of moving them the same number of places.</p>

		<p>The Hill cipher, invented in 1929 by Lester S. Hill was the first practical polygraphic cipher and uses matrix algebra to encrypt blocks of text. Although it was difficult to perform by hand for large texts, the cipher has been implemented in machines or computers, making it one of the last classic ciphers that broke the barrier into modern ciphers</p>

		  <h2>Modern Cryptography</h2>
			<p>Modern cryptography is achieved by using algorithms that have a key for encrypting and decrypting. By using longer keys the data becomes harder and harder to crack through brute force as the attacker would have to try every possible combination. During the 1990s along with the spread of Internet and online transactions, the need for encrypting the data being sent became a must. The first standardised format was <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard">DES</a> (Data Encryption Standard). This has been succeeded by 
			  <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a> (Advanced Encryption Standard), which is used to this day.
